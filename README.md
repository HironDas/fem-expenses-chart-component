## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- [BEM METHODOLOGY](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - A component-based approach for styling pages
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow
- [Solid ](https://www.solidjs.com/) - JS library
- [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) - For building UI components


### What I learned

I used solid-js, storybook, BEM, and d3-js together for the very first time where I used rem instead of px.

### Continued development

I will continue to build projects related to charts/graphs and try to continue the BEM approach to develop components.
